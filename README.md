### DECRA Project Updates

552 of 604 libraries have been sequenced so far. A single plate remains to cover any redos / low coverage samples / final additions.

All reads run through QC, aligned, and compared to confirm general expected relationship (correlation matrix of 100bp tiles of methylation data) based on initial 'low-diversity' GBS classification.

Plant height highlights rapid cycling in spring and longer lived, taller plants in fall. Both show vigor of hybridum.
